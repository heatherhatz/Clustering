# What is Clustering?
It is an unsupervised, machine learning technique for finding hidden patterns in unlabeled data 
Clustering methods
 1. Agglomerative 
 1. Hierarchical
 1. Iterative
      1. K-Means
      1. **K-Modes**
      
K-Modes seeks to place points into a predetermined number of clusters (centroids) based off of how similar these points are to the centroids 
Points are iterated through and moved to different clusters until there is no improvement in the similarity of the cluster
